![Image of a TTP332-based touch sensor. There is a pad labelled "touch" and three terminals for connecting positive, negative (ground), and signal wires.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rbricheno/rbricheno-fritzing-parts/main/TTP223/ttp223.png)

A lovely touch sensor that I bought very cheaply online, for Fritzing.

Based on this part:

(which is CC-BY-SA 3.0, made by adrirobot https://www.adrirobot.it/ ).

Extensively modified, improved, and generally fixed by Fritzing forums user microMerlin https://forum.fritzing.org/u/microMerlin .

I made the new bredboard art, so that is CC0.
